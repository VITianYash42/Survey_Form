-   **Variety of Input Types:** Demonstrates the use of various form elements, including text inputs, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea.
-   **Natural Document Flow:** Built without absolute positioning, relying on a natural and robust block layout that prevents content distortion on resize.

## The Problems I faced while developing and how I fixed them :-

-   **Rigid vs. Responsive Layout**: I initially used a fixed-pixel values and absolute positioning which created a rigid layout that cant adapt to different screen sizes. I refactored it to        be fully responsive using a fluid container and a natural document flow, learning the importance of a mobile-first approach.

-   **HTML Structure**: A persistent bug led me to discover I had incorrectly nested elements in my HTML. Debugging and fixing the structure taught me that clean, semantic HTML is the               essential foundation for predictable CSS.
